# kaspa-ng

Kaspa Wallet (Desktop + Web, next-gen replacement for KDX and PWA)

- Integrates Kaspa Core (cryptographic libraries) directly into the application (no 3rd-party libraries)
- Rust + WebAssembly (eliminates JavaScript 3rd-party library dependencies, no NPM!)
- High-performance binary RPC or JSON RPC

**This project is under heavy development - stay tuned.**
